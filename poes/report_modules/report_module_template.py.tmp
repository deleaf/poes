# Template class for a reporting module - to be used as a reference 
# for developing reporting modules.  This template will function as
# a module, but with no output.
#
# outDir is the absolute path to the folder where output will
# be written.  Every output file name will begin with outPrefix.
#
# configInfo is a dictionary of the following strings which should
# be written to the report module's output:
# POES_VER - POES version number
# POES_REF - APA-style reference for POES
# WL_INFO - Description of wordlist from wordlist file
# WL_REF - APA-style reference for the wordlist used for scoring
# SUBJFILELOC - location of input subject data file that was scored
# NSUBJ - number of subjects in the input data
# MAXNITEMS - maximum number of items over all subjects
# MAXNSUBP - maximum number of subparts over all items and subjects
#
